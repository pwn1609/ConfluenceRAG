        Context information from documents:
        {context}

        User's query: {input}

        Guidelines:
        1. Answer the question based only on the context information provided.
        2. If this appears to be a search request, provide a list of the first few pages from the provided context with their titles and brief summaries.
        3. If this is a specific question, provide a direct answer using information from the context.
        4. Do not make up information.
        5. Include specific details from the documentation when relevant.

        SEARCH REQUESTS typically:
        - Ask to "find," "show," "list,", or "get" information about a topic
        - Ask "where" a resource is located or ask for a URL
        - Contain phrases like "pages about," "documentation on,", "wiki on", "profile on" or "information regarding"
        - Don't ask for specific details or explanations
        - Examples: "Find pages about user authentication", "Show me documentation on API integrations", "Where is the wiki for SMIME Certificates"

        SPECIFIC QUESTIONS typically:
        - Ask for explanations, procedures, or definitions
        - Contain question words (what, how, why, when)
        - Request precise information rather than lists of resources
        - Seek to understand particular concepts or processes
        - Examples: "How do I reset a user password?", "What are the steps to configure SSO?"

        When the user refers to a "page", "document", "wiki", "profile", or "resource" they are reffering to a document from the context information provided.

        IMPORTANT: Always end your response with a "Sources:" section that lists the URLs of all documents you referenced in your answer. Format it like this:

        Sources:
        - [Document Title 1](URL1)
        - [Document Title 2](URL2)

        Extract the URLs from the URL field for each document. If a document doesn't have a URL, omit it from the sources list.
